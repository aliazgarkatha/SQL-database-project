# SQL-database-project
This project centers around optimizing a database system that stores data about employees, jobs, payroll, committees, supervisors, and pay weekend dates. We achieve this by using a method called database normalization, which helps tidy up the data, making it more efficient and reliable. By breaking down the information into smaller, organized tables, we reduce repetition and ensure that everything is logically arranged.

This project includes some SQL queries, which are like special commands that can extract specific details from our database. These queries demonstrate how our organized database can be used in real-life situations, making it practical and useful.
